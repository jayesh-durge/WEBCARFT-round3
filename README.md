<p>this website is an informative single page website, having some intereactive element in it.</p>
<p>i find myself in problem while creating it's layout and while appling animation,transistions in it.</p>
<p>by keeping website minimalist i was able to figure it's layout and for the other part i figure it throguh MDN reference.</p>
<p>iam not familiar with much frame works and libraies so i build it using only HTML and css.</p>
<p>i have learn whole CSS in this webcraft contest only for this round i learn how can we inpliment different transitions, transformations and animations by implimenting them and git-basics.</p>
